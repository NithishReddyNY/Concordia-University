<h1>ENCS 6042 – Communication Techniques in the Innovation Process<h1>

  <h3> Course profile: </h3>
  This course introduces the frameworks around which client centered innovations are designed. The intent is to showcase innovative ideas to use for the public rather than purely from the innovator’s perspective. I want you to be able to talk about your ideas as though you are telling a story.
Topics that will be covered include qualitative analysis, client interview techniques, and of course, presentations of your findings.

  <h3> Learning Objectives </h3>
  The primary objective is for students to be able to justify the case for involvement in activities of innovation. You have the bright ideas, but you need to complement this by <b>quantifying</b> the potential benefits, <b>qualifying</b> the response to them, <b>managing</b> the development of prototypes, and <b>appraising</b> the validity of your innovation throughout. Evaluation during the term is done through:
  
•	Participation in discussions, through which students put the frameworks in each lecture to practice in breakout rooms and during in-class discussions
  
•	Group project, through which students apply what they learned into an innovation project (relax, you are not expected to invent something)
