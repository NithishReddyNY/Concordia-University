<h1>INSE 691: Systems Modeling and Simulation</h1>

<h2>Course Description:</h2>
This course aims to provide theoretical and practical knowledge on advanced systems
modeling and simulation to graduate students. The topics include, fundamentals of systems
simulation, what is a system, what is simulation, steps in constructing a simulation model,
when to use simulation, process mapping, modeling of discrete and continuous systems,
discrete event simulation, system dynamics simulation, uncertainty modeling, monte carlo
simulation, agent based simulation, simulation based optimization, and large scale systems
simulation. The course project will allow the students to apply the various tools and
techniques taught in the course for addressing real-life problems in product- and serviceoriented systems.
